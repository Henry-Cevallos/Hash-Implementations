In this Repository there contains 3 different implementations of Hash Tables.

The first is linear probing.
The second is quadratic probing.
The third is double hash function.

Also included here is a spell checker. We will use wordsEn.txt wich contains
words of the english dictionary and place it into the most efficent hash table, the 
double hash function table. We can then check any text file text file passed for any errors 
by seeing if each word is in the dictionary, if not then it is a misspelled word and the program
will suggest corrections for every word misspelled.
